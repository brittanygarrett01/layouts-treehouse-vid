This is my work from the first part of the Treehouse CSS Layouts video.

I practiced:
Sticky footer
Padding
Mobile first approach
Lots of CSS
Normalize.css

On 5/22 I practiced:
Inline, inline-block, and block styling
I practiced with the treehouse videos and then simultaneously updated this document.
I copy/pasted some code but that's bc I'm not sure about all of the values to use?
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW :)
